                      You go on a date that night and enjoy a high-end meal together.. You pay the bill without a second thought.

                      It was all paid for passively from ATMs you set up around your city. 
                      And every time someone in your city used one of your ATMs, you collected a couple dollars from the surcharge.

          <h2>But, YOU’VE GOT TO MASTER THE MECHANICS OF IT</h2>
          <p>Now, I love the ATM industry.
            There’s a reason I’ve stuck with it for over 30 years. I’ve seen it all here, and I know exactly how to navigate through anything as an ATM business owner. 
            But there are some pitfalls that many ATM business owners, especially new ones, fall into again and again. 
            I’ve seen way too many guys gearing up for a really successful start, all excited for their new passive income stream, only to make one small mistake that costs them their entire business! 
            Everything they invested…just gone. 
            Something as simple as getting into business with the wrong person or not knowing which machine and location is a good investment or who you can trust can really set you back, maybe even permanently.  
            I know there’s a huge growing need for successful LOCAL ATM business owners and operators who know what they’re doing and are doing it right! 
            And that’s why I created…
          </p><br>
          <h2>The ATM Business Road Map</h2>
          <p>This is the only thing you need to get from wherever you are (whether you’re stuck at a dead-end job and just dreaming of a way out or you’re a successful entrepreneur itching for your next stream of income)...all the way to generating a couple grand a month in residual income!  
            It’ll teach you every single step along the way:
          </p><br>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Investing in the best machines for your business and avoiding costly mistakes right off the bat</li>
            <li>Finding those locations that’ll make you the most money and are on a convenient route that allows you to put in the minimal time every week</li>
            <li>Teaching you how and what to say to store owners</li>
            <li>Cruising that route and efficiently setting up and servicing your machines</li>
            <li>Safely handling all the cash for your machines</li>
            <li>And even using some less known strategies to make money from your machines that aren’t just from ATM fees!!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Whether you want to get started with one machine and get a little extra spending money every week or scale up to 12 - 24 machines and make a couple grand each month to support yourself, this business roadmap will guide you straight to your goals. 
            Take a look inside!

            <p>“Since 2017, I have had all my ATM needs & services from ATM Depot flawlessly. I started the ATM business with 1 location, and now I have 24 and looking forward to having more in the near future. Win-win for both. Honestly, I'm feeling really good. I am truly grateful to ATMDepot for their fantastic support from the beginning of my business.”

            <h2 style="color: #f8f8f8;">Meet Your Instructor</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Noah Wieder. I’ve been in the ATM business for over 30 years. Here’s my story.

              After graduating college, I packed up everything I owned in the custom van I built while in college. I drove from upstate New York blizzards to sunny San Diego, California. I had no job lined up, I was just tired of the snow and wanted sunshine and new opportunities, so I started hustling! 
              
              In 1990 I saw the merchant processing business evolving and worked in that industry until I became the first employee of U.S. ATM. I was certified as one of the first Tidel ATM Technicians, then went on to found XtraCash ATM for National Bankcard Association, Inc.  I went one to become one of the first five people asked to become part of the very first Triton ATM Advisory Committee. 
            </p><br>
            <p>I worked my way up the ranks and held quarterly business opportunity training seminars for 4 years and trained over 1000 ATM entrepreneurs. 

              In 1996, I approached the West Coast Mcdonald's controller about placing ATMs in McD’s and I installed ATMs in 190 San Diego area McD’s. We performed various promotional tests and coined the term McMoney, which was approved by McD’s corporate back then. All in all, from 1995 - 2000, I installed over 5,000 ATMs nationwide!
              
              In 2000 I became V.P. of ATM Sales & Marketing for CIBC until 2002 when they decided to sell to eTrade. They wanted me to continue my role, but I knew I could make bank on my own so I cashed out, took a year off, and started ATMDepot.com. 
              
              I took a slow growth approach and didn’t raise any money. I grew the business all from cash flow. My first residual check was barely enough to buy a cup of coffee. Now, we are debt free, manage over 3,000 ATMs, and count almost 2000 IADs as our clients who rely on us for education, training, sales, service, & support.

      <div style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: 40px;" class="FAQs">
        <h2>FAQs</h2><br>
        <h4><b>How do I know this course will work for me?</b></h4><br>
        <p>This course is based on three decades of experience and seeing what works and doesn’t work as an ATM business owner. While I can’t guarantee that this course will 100% work for every single person who takes it, I’m confident that if you put in the work and follow every step I lay out for you in the roadmap, you’ll have everything you need to start making nearly passive income from your ATM business!
          Plus, we really want you to succeed which is why we are also providing a private client Facebook group to help you give you a direct pipeline to updated information to keep current with growing trends in the business.
          Oh, I almost forgot to mention the almost 200 page book and the 160+ page supplemental slide deck and all the resources, cold calling and telemarketing scripts. That’s why we designed it to be something you refer to over and over again.
          I didn’t learn this business in a few hours. I’m not going to B.S. you. This is a serious business and you can earn serious money. You do need to put in the work in the beginning and not quit too soon, if you want to set yourself up to grow your wealth and generate a growing semi-passive income. 
        </p>
        <h4><b>Is there a money-back guarantee?</b></h4>
        <p>Yes! If you’re unhappy with the course for any reason, just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">email us</span> within 30 days of purchase, or before you start Module 4 for a full refund.</p>
        <h4><b>How long will this course take to complete?</b></h4>
        <p>I didn’t design this course to be something you take once and never come back to. I created it as a resource you can come back to over and over again as you progress through different stages in your business. There are over XX hours of video and hundreds of pages of resource material to ensure your success, just follow the Road Map.</p>
